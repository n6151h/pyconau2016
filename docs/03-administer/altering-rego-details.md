Fixing a mistake in a admin created invoice

If you create an invoice and make a mistake you can void the invoice. This will make it as if it didn't exist, it will not refund amounts of money already paid.

Voiding is best done quickly before the user is aware of the invoice. If the invoice has been paid then a refund must be processed.
